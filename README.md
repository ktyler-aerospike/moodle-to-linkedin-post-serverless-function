## **LINKEDIN DEVELOPER ACCOUNT AND APP**
1. Begin by signing up for a LinkedIn developer account. 
1. On the https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps?appStatus=active select **Create App**. and fill out the form.
1. When the app you created opens, choose the **Auth** tab at the top and **Create a Client Secret**. You will enter the id and secret into **Google Cloud Secrets Manager**.
1. On the **Products** tab add the **Share on Linkedin** and **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** products or scopes. 


## **IN GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE**
1. Create a project. 


## **IN GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE - WITH YOUR NEW PROJECT SELECTED**
### Secret Manager
1. Go to **Secret Manager**
1. Click **+ Create Secret**
    1. Name the secret **LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID** and copy/paste the id from Linkedin into the secret value field.
    2. Click Create Secret
1. Repeat the process to set up a **LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET** secret  (add the secret from above).
1. Repeat the process to set up a **FLASK_SECRET** (this is an encryption thing)
1. TODO - add info on how to create the flask secret.


### Create the Cloud Run Function "project" 
1. Go to **Cloud Run Functions**
1. Click **Services** in the side bar.
1. Along the top find the **(...) Write a function link**
1. Choose **Use an inline editor to create a function** (you could alternatively choose the GitHub option)
1. Give your service a name.
1. Choose a region near your moodle instance.
1. Set the endpoint to **Python 3.10**
1. Choose **Allow Public Access** during initial set up for ease of testing. (Later you will lock it down)
1. Click **Create**.

### Copy the files into the Function "project" 
1. Replace the **requirements.txt** and **main.py** file contents with the file contents from this repo.
1. Add an **app.py** file like the one in this repo.
1. Change the function entrypoint to **linkedinposter**
1. Click **Save and redeploy**

### Add Links from Cloud Run to your Secrets
1. After the redeployment is complete, find üñäÔ∏è **Edit & deploy new revision** near the top of the page and click it.
1. You are on the **Containers** MAIN tab. 
1. Halfway down the **Containers** page look for the blue second-level "tab" called **Settings**. Choose **Variables & Secrets** (tag next to it)
1. Click the **+ Reference as secret** button. Create three secrets, link them to the secrets you set up earlier and give them the exact same names. Set them all to "**latest**."
1. At the top of the page, next to the **Containers** tab, choose **Security**.
1. In the **Service Account** field choose **Create a new service account**.
1. The suggest name for the service account will match your cloud run name, add a dash and sa for service account to the end (optional)
1. Click Create.
1. Add Roles **Secret Manager Secret Accessor** and **Cloud Run Invoker** to the service account.
1. Click **Done**.

### Test Setup So Far
1. Back on the Deploy Revision interface, go to the bottom and click **Deploy**. It will likely fail saying something like $${\color{red}The\space service\space account\space used\space must\space be\space granted\space the\space 'Secret\space Manager\space Secret\space Accessor'\space role}$$

### Create a Service Account 
1. After the redeployment has failed, use üñäÔ∏è **Edit & deploy new revision** near the top of the page again.
1. You are on the **Containers** MAIN tab. Switch to the **Security** tab. 
1. In the **Service Account** field, choose **Create new service account**.
1. A sidebar will open and the default name will match your Cloud Run "project" name. I always add a dash and "sa" for Service Account.
1. Click Create.
2. In the Step 2 area add roles: **Cloud Run Invoker, Secret Manager Secret Accessor**
4. Switching your focus back to the main Service Details interface, click Deploy. There should be no errors this time. 

### Test Cloud Run
1. Find the service URL. It will be your Cloud run name, a hashed number, your region, and run.app.
1. Copy and paste the URL somewhere you can easily edit it.
2. Go to the Linkedin developers page and inside your LinkedIn app, find the Auth tab and in the OAuth section add your service URL plus **/auth/linkedin/callback** as an Authorized Redirect URL. 
1. Using the service URL again, add **/auth/linkedin/start?badgeid=aero-101&verifcode=FAKECODE** to the end of the url (instead of /auth/linkedin/callback) 
1. Copy and paste the whole thing into a browswer tab address bar and click **enter**.
1. A LinkedIn login screen should appear. After logging in you should see a button. Click the button and view the post created by this service. The verification will not work bc FAKECODE is not a real certificate but the other link should work. When this service is paired with the Moodle plugin, a real certificate code is passed along and can be verified.

## SECURING THE PROCESS
1. Once the above is working, test it by triggering it from moodle. You will need to go into the Moodle Site Admin Plugins page and find the Local section and click on **LinkedIn Share for Certificates** in the Gateway Endpoint field. put your SERVICE URL again (nothing added to the end) TODO - or do we add auth/linkedin/start (will depend on final solution.
2. Test the process end to end by triggering the share from the course banner share button. If it works, it's time to lock it down.
3. We have tried JWT tokens, and a gateway. Now we are trying restricted ingress. We'll have to see what happens.
